# Teknuance-Research-Internship
This repository contains Code, Data and Documentation of Research Internship at Teknuance.

Worked on unsupervised clustering of tables in a Database based on the attributes. 

From the clusters, an Entity - Relationship Diagram was formed automatically. 

All code was reviewed, perfected, and pushed to production.

Abstract of the Research Internship :

An auto-modelling system which when given the Table names of
a database will form clusters of the tables such that the Entity-Relationship
Diagrams between the tables of a particular cluster can be formed using foreign
key and primary key relationships was developed using Machine Learning Algorithms.
